                <details>
                    <summary>When did cake first appear in the America</summary>
                    <p>Cake has been enjoyed in the United States since the colonial era. The concept of cake was introduced by European settlers who brought their traditional baking practices and recipes with them. The exact date of the first appearance of cake in the United States is difficult to determine, as it likely varied depending on the region and the specific community of settlers. However, by the 18th century, cakes were commonly baked for special occasions such as weddings, birthdays, and holidays. Over time, American culinary traditions evolved, and various cake recipes and styles developed, leading to the wide range of cakes enjoyed in the United States today.
